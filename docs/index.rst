swprocess Documentation
=======================

`swprocess` is a Python package for surface wave processing.

`swprocess` supports:

* processing of active-source surface wave data (i.e., MASW),
* post-processing of passive-wavefield surface wave data (i.e., MAM) processed using Geopsy,
* combining active-source and/or passive-wavefield dispersion data from different arrays, and
* calculation of rigorous surface wave dispersion statistics.
